# Dr. Michael Edesess

## Chief Investment Strategist

Without a doubt, Michael is quite accomplished: Ph.D. in pure mathematics; economist; investment professional; author. He’s built financial planning models used at several of the world’s largest banking and consulting firms, including The Bank of New York, Smith Barney, and Pershing. He is a visiting fellow in the Centre for Systems Informatics Engineering at City University of Hong Kong, and a research associate of the EDHEC – Risk Institute. Michael is most proud of his book, “The Big Investment Lie”, which shatters myths about financial advice, and the book he co-authored, “The 3 Simple Rules of Investing: Why Everything You’ve Heard About Investing Is Wrong — And What to Do Instead”, which further affirms his commitment to transparency in investing. In addition to his work in investments, Dr. Edesess has been active in nonprofit organizations, including International Development Enterprises USA, which focuses on rural smallholders in developing countries.
