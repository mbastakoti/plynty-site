# Dirk Roper

## Chief Financial Planner

Dirk has dedicated his multifaceted career to the creation of thoughtful financial planning tools that help the underserved. He was the architect and lead developer on a computerized financial planning product that ultimately became Kiplinger’s Net Wealth (by H&R Block). Dirk is also the owner of a small family business, which means he always has financial planning top of mind. When away from his keyboard, Dirk cruises on his motorcycle and perfects his digital photography — there’s a lot of world out there he hopes to capture.
