# you already understand this — really! 
You probably already manage your money on a regular basis, tracking how much you earn and 
spend. Yep, whether you write it down or guesstimate, you likely have a good idea of what 
comes in and where it goes. This is your <i>everyday</i> cashflow.

Since that’s the way you plan for today, that’s the way *plynty* helps you plan for retirement. No 
intimidating techniques. *plynty* builds off your familiarity with cashflow and allows you to 
understand your future cashflow as clearly as you know today’s.

*It’s what we call “<i>lifelong cashflow</i>”.*
