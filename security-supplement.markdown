# Security Supplement
Last updated: March 12, 2017


We deploy a comprehensive set of security safeguards and procedures to help keep your personal information safe.

{% include icon-bullet.html heading="&nbsp;layered physical security" %} 

The plynty app does not store any personal information on your mobile device. So, should someone gain access to your phone or tablet, they cannot compromise your account credentials and private data.
 
Our servers are hosted on Amazon Web Services® and shielded from hackers behind their secure and continuously monitored firewalls.
 
{% include icon-bullet.html heading="&nbsp;strong encryption" %}

Your data is SSL encrypted when in transit and AES-256 encrypted while on our servers. These encryption techniques are the most secure in the financial industry, and help keep your data safe from prying eyes.
 
{% include icon-bullet.html heading="&nbsp;strict policies and rigorous controls" %}

We institute stringent, systematic controls to govern and audit the operation and maintenance of plynty. Your data and its backup are continuously monitored, and account access is logged and audited. Likewise, access to our office facilities is restricted and monitored. Every member on the plynty staff must pass a criminal background check. And, no member of staff has access to your account credentials.
 
{% include icon-bullet.html heading="&nbsp;third party verification" %}


Our data security policy is comprehensive and is tested regularly by Veris Group®, a leading cybersecurity firm.
 
Our online identity has been verified by Entrust®.  When visiting the plynty website look for our security seal and certificate at [plynty.com](http://plynty.com). 
 
{% include icon-bullet.html heading="&nbsp;two-factor authentication" %}

Two-factor authentication adds a layer of strong authentication to the plynty app, which helps safeguard your information from theft. With two-factor authentication, each time you sign in, you’ll be asked to enter a unique 7-digit code to verify your identity.  The code is sent to your mobile device from our partner in data security, Authy®.
