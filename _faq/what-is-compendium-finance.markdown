Compendium Finance is another wholly owned subsidiary of AEM Corporation. We created a separate company so that we could offer investment advisory and portfolio management services. Compendium Finance works with plynty to power answers to retirement questions sent by our subscribers.

Some of the same people who work at Compendium Finance are on the founding team at plynty. Weâ€™ve benefited from their expertise many times.
