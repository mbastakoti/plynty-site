plynty is a social enterprise developed by AEM Corporation. AEM traditionally works with federal agencies and large companies, so this is a new kind of initiative.

The app combines AEM capabilities in IT and data analysis with the financial expertise of the app’s founding team, which includes accomplished authors, analysts, and financial advisors.

More about plynty’s history, philosophy, and features is available at our website: plynty.com.

We also partner with Compendium Finance so that we can provide objective investment advice.
