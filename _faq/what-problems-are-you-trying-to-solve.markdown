Our team comes from the financial industry. Frankly, we saw that retirement planning doesn’t work for a lot of people. Financial planners can be hard to identify, cost a lot of money, and are often difficult to evaluate for the value they add.

Online retirement calculators also leave a lot to be desired. They are too simple and still somehow too hard to understand. They show confusing graphs, set large sums of money as a target, and use rules of thumb to only indicate whether you are “on track.” It’s hard to know what you’re getting in retirement, and it’s not clear what options you have along the way to meet your goals.

We are passionate about solving these problems. Our team has been cited by major outlets like the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post for research on how to make retirement planning simple and more effective.
