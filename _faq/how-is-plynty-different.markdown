Today’s retirement calculators aren’t helpful. They calculate an impossible financial goal, usually with no help or hope to reach it. They are too simple and yet still somehow too hard to understand. Most important, it’s impossible to know what your income will be in retirement or the choices you should make along the way to make sure you meet your goals.

*plynty* is different. The app walks you through the creation of a realistic retirement budget. We use your inputs and real data from the Bureau of Labor & Statistics to predict your retirement expenses. We then help you identify all of the possible income sources you can expect. The resulting outcome uses patent-pending algorithms to calculate your retirement budget. You can easily see how your expenses and income compare.  

The app offers effective tips to reduce your expenses and increase your income in retirement.  Knowing this information early and monitoring it throughout your working years makes achieving your goals very possible.  

No one else does that.
