Save a large nest egg - it’s what traditional retirement calculators advise. If you’re like most people, it’s just not realistic to save as much for retirement as these calculators recommend. You’re left guessing what saving less will mean for your retirement or, maybe you just give up planning for retirement altogether.

*plynty* is different.  We see savings as just one important piece of building successful lifelong cashflow™.  We offer practical, common sense advice so you can earn the most in retirement income, spend the least in retirement expenses, and find a healthy balance in your financial life.
