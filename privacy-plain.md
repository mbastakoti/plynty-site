# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 22, 2017

Welcome and thank you for your interest in plynty, LLC (“plynty”).  This Privacy Policy expresses our commitment to the protection of your privacy. We share this document to help you understand what personal information we collect, how that information is used to serve you, and how your privacy is safeguarded. You are consenting to the privacy practices explained within this Policy by using the services we offer.

Your questions and comments on this policy are welcome at support@plynty.com.

This Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use govern your use of our website and mobile app services. Our Terms of Use takes precedence over any conflicting Privacy Policy provision.

## 1. APPLICABILITY

This Privacy Policy applies to all information gathered from you through use of our products and services, which includes our web site http://www.plynty.com and our mobile app (the “plynty Services” or “Services”).

The term “Personal Information” is used throughout this document to describe data that can be associated with a specific individual and can be used to identify that individual. Personal Information does not include data that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific individual.

## 2. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED

When you register an account with plynty or use its Services, you voluntarily provide us information about yourself. What Personal Information we collect is dependent upon what you choose to do. The following are categories of the Personal Information we gather:

plynty Account Information: When registering a new plynty account (the “Account”), the Personal Information collected includes your name, email address, mobile number, and account credentials for use during authentication and account access.

Demographic information: The minimum Personal Information needed to provide you cursory financial insight and recommendations is marital status, date(s) of birth, and current annual household income.

Financial Account Information: Any in depth analysis of your financial situation and strategies requires a gathering of financial account information such as but not limited to pension and annuity payout schedules, social security benefits, investment holdings, balances and planned contributions, mortgage obligations, and rental and alimony incomes. Financial account information may be entered manually by you or it may be collected automatically from your financial institution accounts. Automated collection is an optional service, and is facilitated by a trusted third party institution. The login credentials for your financial institution accounts are saved by the third party, not by us.

Tax identification: With some optional transactions as such opening a brokerage account, your full legal name, permanent mailing address, and tax information is collected, as required by law.

Service Information: Your trust in and satisfaction with the plynty Services are taken seriously. Our customer support team may collect additional information about you or from you. Examples may be assistance we provide in resolving a problem you encountered, or your response to a satisfaction survey.

We collect Personal Information with one sole purpose: to deliver the personalized financial service and customer support that you request.
