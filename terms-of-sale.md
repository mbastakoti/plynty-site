# Terms of Sale

Last updated : July 31, 2018

This Terms of Sale governs the sale of subscription for the plynty mobile app and webapp (the “plynty app”). By using the plynty app, you also agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. 

## Auto-renewing Subscription

You must be a citizen or a legal resident of the United States and at least eighteen (18) years of age to purchase a plynty subscription.  When you purchase a plynty subscription, the price will be made clear during the order process. You agree to pay the price that is stated at the time of your order, as well as any applicable taxes. You also agree to the billing frequency (“Billing Period”) stated at the time of your order. All prices are in United States Dollars.

Your plynty subscription will auto-renew at the end of the Billing Period unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You can view the date of your next scheduled payment by visiting the plynty webapp and selecting “Subscription” from the menu. You will be notified in advance of impending renewals and again when your subscription has auto-renewed.

## Billing

### Payment Method

You can pay for your subscription with a major credit card or debit card (“Payment Method”). Only credit cards and debit cards are eligible for payment. You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting the plynty webapp and selecting “Subscription” from the menu. If your payment is unsuccessful by reason of insufficient funds, expiration, or otherwise, your further use of the plynty app will be disallowed.

### Recurring Billing

By placing an order for a subscription, you authorize us to charge you the subscription fee, then in effect, at the beginning of each Billing Period, plus applicable taxes, to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount charged each Billing Period may vary for reasons that may include price changes or changes in applicable taxes, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amount each Billing Period. We automatically bill your Payment Method at the end of the cycle stated at the time of your order. If your Payment Method is declined for a recurring payment of your subscription fee, an alternative accepted Payment Method will be required before access is again allowed to the plynty app.

### Price Changes

We reserve the right to change the subscription fees at any time. We will notify you of any change, if your subscription fees change from what was stated at the time of your initial order. You will have an opportunity to cancel your subscription at that time. If you do not cancel your subscription, you will be charged the new subscription fee at your next Billing Period.

### Billing Period

We will charge the subscription fee at the commencement of your subscription, and automatically at the end of the Billing Period, unless and until your subscription is cancelled.

## Cancellations and Refunds

You can cancel your subscription at any time by visiting the plynty webapp and selecting “Subscription” from the menu. You must cancel your subscription before it renews to avoid billing of the next Billing Period’s subscription fees to your Payment Method.

Payments are non-refundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used Billing Periods. We reserve the right, however, to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit in one instance, we are under no obligation to issue the same refund or credit in the future.

## Changes to the Terms of Sale

We are continuously striving to improve our services, and may change this Terms of Sale as the need arises. If we modify this Terms of Sale, we will make it available on our website and revise the date of revision.
