“There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.” - Warren Buffett 

Welcome to the plynty blog! This is where we’ll explain <i>how</i> we see money differently, and what that can mean for your retirement planning (hint: it’s much easier than you think!).<!--more--> Along the way we’ll expose the myths behind traditional financial planning and make it what it should be —effortless. Because understanding a few simple tips can make your life a lot less stressful.

In our upcoming posts, we’ll share the secret to an attainable retirement plan and the biggest risk you’ll face trying to reach it. And we’ll get better acquainted by sharing more about our team, what motivates us, and how the plynty app is designed so that anyone can create a financial plan that will work for them.

Sometimes we’ll dive deeper into more complex subjects so that you’ll have a better understanding of why we recommend (or don’t) certain strategies. If a topic is really complicated, we’ll break it up into several posts — after all, we’re not trying to get you to read a financial version of “War and Peace” every time you drop by.

For those who like even more technical knowledge, we’ll sometimes include links to articles we think will provide you with unbiased, truly helpful information. Eventually, you’ll have so much knowledge that you’ll be comfortable saying things like “what? you use asset allocation? that’s old school!” And you’ll know exactly why, as well as the positive difference plynty makes to your retirement plan.

But retirement planning is not just about numbers. It’s a lifelong project which should always take into account your goals and dreams. If you can’t achieve them today, then <i>plan</i> them into your future. Viewing retirement planning in this way is part of how we see money differently — we call it “lifelong cashflow.” You’ll read a lot about it in future posts.

E-mail us your ideas, and we’ll share our perspective on the thoughts listed above. Stay tuned.
