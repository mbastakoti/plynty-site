Creating a retirement plan is like trying out a new recipe. With some basic ingredient prep and by following the directions, there’s a good chance you’ll create something that will make your inner chef proud. Of course, once you get started cooking and gain some confidence, you often discover modifications that make a recipe more appealing, as well as a better fit for you.

The plynty planning app offers you variations on a straightforward financial recipe that your grandparents may have used: start with income, add in savings, and decide what optional “ingredients” (life insurance, annuities, etc.) will result in future happiness — and not heartburn! Ready to get started?

**Ingredients:**
1. Crystal Ball
2. Balance
3. Perspective

**Prep time:** 10-30 minutes, on average

**Total time:** Your choice, over your lifetime

**Notes:** Use plynty to combine ingredients.

**Instructions:**
First, start with a crystal ball. Yes, you read that right. Look into your future, both known (social security, pension, existing savings, health issues) and unknown. Don’t worry yet about IF you’ll be able to achieve those unknowns. You need to know what you’d like to plan for before you can put together a recipe for success.

Second, add a healthy helping of balance. If you read our previous post on lifelong cashflow (hint, hint), you know this starts with current income and expenses. Identifying needs versus wants. Evaluating current needs versus future needs. All balanced over time, so that you aren’t planning just for an endpoint but for your lifetime.

Finally, top it off with a big dollop of perspective. Financial planning is as much about lifestyle as it is saving and investing. Imagine how various scenarios might work for you: a second career, getting a reverse mortgage, moving in with the kids. Mix and match options to see what your income and expenses might look like.

Now use the plynty app to bring everything together. Easy to set up, it will hum along in the background to help keep you on track. Checking in every couple of weeks or so will ensure that the ingredients you’ve chosen for your plan are still the best fit for you. Plynty allows you to stay focused on the present while never losing sight of your future. Bon appetite!
