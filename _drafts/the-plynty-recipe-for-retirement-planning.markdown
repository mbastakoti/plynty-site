Creating a retirement plan is like trying out a new recipe –  with proper ingredient preparation and by following the directions, there’s a good chance you’ll create something that will make you proud. Of course, once you started cooking and gain some confidence and experience, you often discover modifications that make a recipe a better fit for you.

The plynty planning app allows you to create variations of a straightforward financial recipe that may have been passed down for generations in your family: start with income, add in savings, and decide what optional “ingredients” (life insurance, annuities, etc.) to add to suit your own tastes — without giving you heartburn as a result. The recipe below has a longer preparation time for the ingredients, but once they are prepped, the final product takes less time to come together.

3. Balance and Perspective

DIRECTIONS

1. **Prep a list of your planned retirement income sources.** 
Make a list of your planned retirement income sources. If you have an online account, have your log in information ready at hand. If you contribute to a 401(k), make sure you know how much you and your employer currently contribute. If you have investment accounts, check for any advisor fees.
We’ve created a short list of common income sources to use as your starting point:
* Withdrawals from savings (e.g., cash, 401(k), IRA, investment accounts, HSA)
* Government-sponsored benefits (e.g., Social Security payments)
* Employer-sponsored benefits (e.g., pensions)
* Salary (e.g., full-time or part-time retirement job)
* Other (e.g., rental, small business profits, alimony)

2. **Prep a list of your planned retirement expenses.**
Make a list of your planned retirement expenses. If you are considering housing expenses, think about whether you plan to pay off your mortgage by retirement, or if you will live in your current home in retirement. We’ve created a short list of common retirement expenses to use as your starting point: 
* Housing expenses (e.g., mortgage/rent, property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, home maintenance/repair, home warranty)
* Essential living expenses (e.g., food, clothing, and utilities)
* Non-essential living expenses (e.g., entertainment, dining out, hobbies, subscriptions, gifts)
* Healthcare 
* Travel

3. **Use plynty to combine your ingredients.**
Slowly add in your income sources and expenses one at a time into the app and allow it to calculate your projected cashflow in retirement. Consider adding in optional ingredients such as annuities and whole-life insurance to protect yourself against the risk of outliving your savings and to protect your loved ones. It is important to maintain flexibility and make changes to your plan as life circumstances change (such as starting a new job with a new 401(k)). 

Plynty will hum along in the background to help keep you on track. Checking in every couple of weeks or so will ensure that the ingredients you’ve chosen for your plan are still the best fit for you. Plynty allows you to stay focused on the present while never losing sight of your future. Bon appétit!
