“There has been a lot of moving around, in my career,” says Robert Woodward, 64. “It was not a traditional path.”

That path began, steadily enough, with a bachelor’s degree in geology from the University of Arizona and a summer job at ARCO International Oil & Gas. There, Robert sharpened his skills in mapping and exploration, which helped propel him into graduate work in geology at the University of Southern California in the late 1970s.

“When I was done with school,” Robert remembers, “I found myself back at ARCO. I was an exploration geologist, so the job meant we lived in Anchorage, in Lafayette, in Takarta, in Plano, and in Tunisia.”

All of that exploration made Robert and his wife, Jennifer, 62, uniquely adaptable to change. Jennifer’s career — seasoned with jobs at an Alaskan department of Parks & Recreation, at a legal office, and as a teacher in an American school in Tunisia — matched Robert’s, step for step, as the couple and their two children moved around the world.

“We didn’t think a lot about retirement, then,” Jennifer admits, “but we got more serious [about it] as time went on.”
